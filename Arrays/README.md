# Arrays Practice

This assignment will help you review what we have covered with arrays, as well as how to use methods and loops.

The end goal is to print the difference between the largest and smallest out of an user-determined number of values given by a user.

## Specifications

1. Ask the user for the number of values they will enter, then put the values they input into an array.

2. Create a method that takes an array of ints as a parameter and returns an array with the minimum value in the first slot and the maximum value in the second slot.

3. Create a method that takes an array of ints (which should have the minimum value in the first slot and the maximum value in the second slot) and returns the difference between the largest and smallest values.

4. In `main`, print the difference by calling the two methods you created.

### Sample Outputs

```
How many numbers do you have? 5
Enter the next number: 231
Enter the next number: 1
Enter the next number: -10
Enter the next number: 25
Enter the next number: 88

The difference between the largest and smallest values is 241
```

```
How many numbers do you have? 3
Enter the next number: -10
Enter the next number: -33
Enter the next number: -90

The difference between the largest and smallest values is 80
```
